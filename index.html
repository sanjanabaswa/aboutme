                <h2>Background</h2>

                I'm from Gladstone, Missouri which is a suburb of Kansas City. I went to Oak Park High School and participated in pretty much all the bands and choirs there. I took my first programming class my last semester high school and fell in love with it. That is how I decided on my major.

                As for prior experience, I worked as a Quality Assurance Intern for American Century Investments this past summer. 
                
                My job consisted mostly of developing and running automated tests. I was also responsible for investigating and reporting failures. I got to be part of a scrum team and learn about Agile development. I've accepted an internship for this coming summer as a Software Engineer Intern at Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, Iowa.
                 
                I am very excited for this opportunity and cannot wait to learn from more real world.
